Stashbox and its extensions are distributed via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=stashbox) packages.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Package Manager" label="Package Manager">

You can install the package by typing the following into the Package Manager Console:
```powershell
Install-Package Stashbox -Version 5.16.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet CLI" label="dotnet CLI">

You can install the package by using the dotnet cli:
```bash
dotnet add package Stashbox --version 5.16.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PackageReference" label="PackageReference">

You can add the package into the package references of your `.csproj`:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Stashbox" Version="5.16.0" />
```

## Usage
The general idea behind using Stashbox is that you structure your code with loosely coupled components with the [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle), [Inversion Of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) and [Dependency Injection](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) in mind. 

Rather than letting the services instantiate their dependencies inside themselves, inject the dependencies on construction. Also, rather than creating the object hierarchy manually, you can use a Dependency Injection framework that does the work for you. That's why you are here, I suppose. ðŸ™‚

To achieve the most efficient usage of Stashbox, you should follow these steps:
- At the startup of your application, instantiate a `StashboxContainer`.
- Register your services into the container.
- [Validate](/docs/diagnostics/validation) the state of the container and the registrations with the `.Validate()` method. *(Optional)*
- During the lifetime of the application, use the container to resolve your services.
- Create [scopes](/docs/guides/scopes) and use them to resolve your services. *(Optional)*
- On application exit, call the container's `.Dispose()` or `.DisposeAsync()` method to clean up the resources. *(Optional)*

:::caution
You should create only a single instance from `StashboxContainer` (plus child containers if you use them) per application domain. `StashboxContainer` instances are thread-safe. Do not create new container instances continuously, such action will bypass the container's internal delegate cache and could lead to performance degradation. 
:::

## How it works?
Stashbox builds and maintains a collection of [registered services](/docs/getting-started/glossary#service-registration--registered-service). When a service is requested for resolution, Stashbox starts looking for a matching registration that has the same [service type](/docs/getting-started/glossary#service-type--implementation-type) as the type that was requested. If it finds one, the container initiates a scan on the [implementation type's](/docs/getting-started/glossary#service-type--implementation-type) available constructors and selects the one with the most arguments it knows how to resolve by matching argument types to other registrations.

When every constructor argument has a companion registration, Stashbox jumps to the first one and continues the same scanning operation. 

This process is repeated until every [injectable dependency](/docs/getting-started/glossary#injectable-dependency) has a matching registration in the [resolution tree](/docs/getting-started/glossary#resolution-tree). At the end of the process, Stashbox will have each dependency node built-up in a hierarchical object structure to instantiate the initially requested service object.

## Example
Let's see a quick example. We have three services `DbBackup`, `MessageBus` and `ConsoleLogger`. `DbBackup` has a dependency on `IEventBroadcaster` (implemented by `MessageBus`) and `ILogger` (implemented by `ConsoleLogger`), `MessageBus` also depending on an `ILogger`:
```cs
public interface IJob { void DoTheJob(); }

public interface ILogger { void Log(string message); }

public interface IEventBroadcaster { void Broadcast(IEvent @event); }


public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}

public class MessageBus : IEventBroadcaster
{
    private readonly ILogger logger;

    public MessageBus(ILogger logger)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    void Broadcast(IEvent @event) 
    {
        this.logger.Log($"Sending event to bus: {@event.Name}");
        // Do the actual event broadcast.
    }
}

public class DbBackup : IJob
{
    private readonly ILogger logger;
    private readonly IEventBroadcaster eventBroadcaster;

    public DbBackup(ILogger logger, IEventBroadcaster eventBroadcaster)
    {
        this.logger = logger;
        this.eventBroadcaster = eventBroadcaster;
    }

    public void DoTheJob() 
    {
        this.logger.Log("Backing up!");
        // Do the actual backup.
        this.eventBroadcaster.Broadcast(new DbBackupCompleted());
    } 
}
```

:::info
By depending only on interfaces, you decouple your services from concrete implementations. This gives you the flexibility of a more comfortable implementation replacement and also isolates your components from each other. For example, unit testing benefits a lot from the possibility of replacing real implementations with mocks.

The example above configured with Stashbox in a Console Application:

```cs
using Stashbox;
using System;

namespace Example
{
    public class Program
    {
        private static readonly IStashboxContainer container;

        static Program()
        {
            // 1. Create container
            container = new StashboxContainer();

            // 2. Register your services
            container.RegisterSingleton<ILogger, ConsoleLogger>();
            container.Register<IEventBroadcaster, MessageBus>();
            container.Register<IJob, DbBackup>();

            // 3. Validate the configuration.
            container.Validate();
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // 4. Resolve and use your service
            var job = container.Resolve<IJob>();
            job.DoTheJob();
        }
    }
}
```
